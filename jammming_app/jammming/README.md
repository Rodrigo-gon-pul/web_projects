# Jammming
## Project description:  
In this project, you will build a React web application called Jammming. You will use your knowledge of React components, passing state, and requests with the Spotify API to build a website that allows users to search the Spotify library, create a custom playlist, then save it to their Spotify account.
## Key concepts:  
1. Use JSX and basic React sintax
2. Pass information between React components using props
3. Manage component data with React state
4. Interact with a third party API (Spotify).
