# Fake Python Jobs web Scrapping
## Description:
In this tutorial, I’ll build a web scraper that fetches Python software developer job listings from the Fake Python Jobs site. It’s an example site with fake job postings that we can freely scrape to train our skills. This web scraper will parse the HTML on the site to pick out the relevant information and filter that content for specific words. Finally, I'll create a Pandas DataFrame containing relevant info about Python related jobs.
## Objectives:  
- Inspect the HTML structure of your target site with your browser’s developer tools
- Decipher data encoded in URLs
- Use requests and Beautiful Soup for scraping and parsing data from the Web
- Step through a web scraping pipeline from start to finish
- Build a script that fetches job offers from the Web
- Use DataFrames to store structured information
